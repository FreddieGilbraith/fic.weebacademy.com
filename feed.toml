<p>"I thought I could smell a rat" said Ging, his eyes settling on the lithe and contorted form of Pariston, splayed across the throne in the center of the room.</p>
<p>"Very funny, but don't be so boreish", the quick-witted mouse bastard replied, "I was wondering how long it would take you to figure out it was me."</p>
<p>Ging was angry now, he strode towards Pariston and pinned him against the wall. "No one neglects Gon but me, you hear me!?!"</p>
<p>"I thought this would rile you up", smirked Pariston, his lips an inch from Ging's "Revoking a hunter licence: the ultimate neglect."</p>
<p>Ging tousled his already extremely tousled hair. Removing the confusing mess of scarves from his extraordinarily tousled hair, he sat down across from the immaculately dressed figure on the other side of the table. His immaculately dressed nemesis, Pariston Hill. Having seen him from across the restaurant, Ging was always a little overcome. The slick figure Pariston cut belied his cunning. Their rivalry at opposing law-firms was legendary and to watch them debate was to watch a gold medal pair of figure skaters go about their work. Their hatred (more accurately Ging's hatred) had made for an excruciating and tense dance over the years.</p>
<p>'Ging, good to see you' Pariston smiled, debonairly. 'I've already asked for the wine' </p>
<p>'Why did you invite me here Pariston?' </p>
<p>'Ah yes, the Boar has no patience, no tact. Won't even wait for the wine and entree's to be served. Well Ging, I have a proposition for you'</p>
<p>'We aren't making a deal on the Zoldyk Case Pariston, there's nothing to talk about here'</p>
<p>'Ah Ging' Said Pariston, his eyes suddenly filling with veracious intensity, 'I had a different proposition in mind'</p>
<p>'We...you... you can't mean? We said we'd never revisit that night....' </p>
<p>The wine was set down on the table and Pariston leaned across the table filling Ging's glass to almost the brim</p>
<p>'Ging, I know you can't resist sparring with an old enemy. Why not? All the trials are becoming boring to me, I want to win a much more exciting prize.'</p>
<p>Ging wiped the seamen from his face, wincing.</p>
<p>Pariston smiled implacably, his eyes hollow as ever. "Imagine if the hunter assassination could see you right now. Triple star hunter Ging Freecs with cum splashed across his belly." His voice was friendly and passive, which for Pariston meant threatening. </p>
<p>As if obliviousness to the cruel note his voice had taken, Ging responded with a rough, "Eh? What?"</p>
<p>Pariston continued, unshaken by the man's seeming lack of self-awareness. "You really want people to know that we...well, how you came undone at my hands?" He gestured to the evidence, which Ging was absent mindedly smearing across his chest.</p>
<p>"What? I don't care about that! I just wanted to make sure I could see these little suckers," he gestered at his sperm,</p>
<p>"where you can see them?" Pariston's eyebrows creased.</p>
<p>"Yea, need to keep my eye on them. Make sure they don't turn into another fucking kid."</p>
<p>Pariston sighed, deciding not to inform Ging that he had paid more attention to the sperm that currently coated his chest, than he ever had to his living son. </p>
<p>"Right," Ging continued still oblivious, "now I want you to jerk me off at the top of that really old tree."</p>

<p>"Dududududududy - It's super crazy slots time," said Kite's super crazy slot clown. Kite as you'll recall was dead, but his love of circus themed gambling devices had lived on after him through his post-mortem nen. So now the crazy-slot clown was alive, and without a master to harness him, was trying to navigate life as a free man, and significantly as a bachelor. </p>
<p>"Hmmmm," Hisoka said, stroking the long wooden stick that the slot-machine was attached too, wondering what number would come up. </p>
<p>"Number 5, dinner and a movie!" The crazy slot clown said, and he rolled the number wheel that functioned as one of his eyes, hoping it would approximate the wink he had often seen the wiley and sensual Kite bestow upon his paramours. </p>
<p>Hisoka sighed, usually he only dated pre-pubescent boys and goths, but it had been a long time after all, and maybe it would be nice not to be the person making all the effort....for once.</p>
<p>Hisoka eyed the clown up greedily, as number after number cascaded down his mouth. He licked his lips with expectation; whichever number would he land on?</p>
<p>With each whirling second that passed Hisoka's blood lust grew, his eyes began to roll back into his head, and the familiar rainbow shakes ran the length of his body.</p>
<p>"69", the Crazy Slot Clown finally announced.</p>
<p>"Good Roll", Hisoka muttered to himself wryly, before striding flouncily towards the floating jester. He conjured a thin film of bungie gum as he walked, and deftly wrapped his member in it. Safety first.</p>
<p>As he drew abreast of the Hatsu-conjoured Harlequin he whispered, "let's dance"</p>
<p>'You see clown' said Hisoka, stroking his make-upped chin - 'My aura has the properties of both rubber and gum, but more importantly you're just a head' </p>
<p>'WHAT DO YOU MEAN?' Screamed the Slot-CLown head, blushing underneath his red cheek dots.</p>
<p>Hisoka smirked darkly, shooting him a scintillating look.</p>
<p>'We don't have to buy a condom' </p>
<p>The clown opened his mouth to loudly scream and objection, when he felt something hard hit the back of his throat. </p>
<p>The clown had been waiting for this to happen. He just didn't think it would happen like this. Not here. </p>
<p>'haha' smirked the slender clown, his hand nestled on the floating head's hat 'finally a good roll'.</p>

<p>"Bring in another", the King of the Ants ordered his guard, before the head of the human before him had even hit the ground. Meruem had just defeated the world's highest ranked Magic the Gathering player with a deft White/Green combo deck, while retaining almost all of his Land cards.</p>
<p>The King was beginning to bore, three straight weeks of this and still not a single human even approaching his equal.</p>
<p>"My Liege," said Poofu, bowing deeply and crying, "Yami Yugi, the human Duel Monsters Champion"</p>
<p>The man who now entered the room stood in stark contrast to the melancholic parade of shambling human filth that the king had so far subjected himself to: He stood tall and proud, his hair making up at least 1 quarter of his height.</p>
<p>"That's King of Games to you, Ant!"</p>
<p>Meruem threw the cards across the holographic duelling area, scowling. He had lost again.</p>
<p>Yami smirked, that self-satisfied, shit eating smirk. "Again? He asked, gesturing to the field."</p>
<p>"How...how can you defeat me? I am King of the Ants! God of my people, the culmination of thousands of years of evolution!"</p>
<p>"The ancient Egyptian's didn't believe in evolution." Yami replied, and Meruem's scowl deepened. Yami however was not deterred by this, despite having seen Meruem slice Joey's head off for insolence mere days ago, and he continued, "instead of using your head, try connecting with the cards themselves. Allow the heart of the cards to guide you. Let the cards into...your heart."</p>
<p>From where he was watching in the stands Pouf frowned. Meruem had gone silent. Not one other player had been able to confuse him like this.</p>
<p>"You really think...that I have a heart?"</p>
<p>Now it was Yami's turn to be caught of guard. And he swallowed before answering, serious now, "I know you do."</p>
<p>Pouf dropped his book. This 'King of Games' was going to be trouble. </p>
<p>Yami Yugi looked over his shoulder at the ant king, right leg raised on the bed, still pushed deep within him, and felt the warmth of the ant king pulse through him. </p>
<p>'So Pharaoh' said meruem, hand still grasping yami's hair 'are you still the king of all games?' </p>
<p>Yami felt his knees go weak and he fell forwards on the bed. Cum dripping from him, he looked up at the somehow still helmeted visge of meruem.</p>
<p>'This was a shadow game I could not win, I must reliquish my crown and my servants to you'</p>
<p>He glanced over at his ages-long companion, the Dark Magician, gagged and bound, dripping with semen like his pharaoh. </p>
<p>'I'm sorry old friend' Yami stammered, 'we have a new king now'."One date, then."</p>

<p>Welfin looked in the mirror, appraising himself, looking into his own face for any sign of hesitation or doubt.</p>
<p>"You talking to me?" He growled, "There's nobody else here so you must be talking to me!"</p>
<p>His reflection growled back at him and Welfin frowned. Just what was he up too? What were his motivations? Could he trust that he was on his own side? Welfin ran a claw through the messy fur atop his head. He was finding himself to be more trouble than he was worth....and yet...</p>
<p>There was a small part of him, a part he would never admit to anyone and certainly not share with himself, that found his own motive ambiguity intriguing. You see...he never knew what he was really thinking, whether he meant a word he said, and a man like that was dangerous. Dangerous and attractive. Never knowing if a touch was true or false, never knowing if the sweet nothings he spoke outloud to himself in the dead of night, were heartfelt, or simply empty platitudes formulated to keep him on task. Truly, he was a mysterious femme fatale. If Welfin was honest with himself (which of course he never could just be in case he betrayed himself) he would have realised that he possessed within himself, a sexy, unknowable, creature that he could not tame. A wild beast. And he loved it.</p>
<p>Staring into the mirror, Welfin beheld this projection of his subconscious and felt himself stir. </p>
<p>Something about this alien aspect of himself, so suspicious of everything, so profoundly questioning, turned him on in the extreme.</p>
<p>He locked eyes with his suspicious, mirror self and grasped at his wolf/ant penis. Watching as his doppleganger also did so, suspiciously. </p>
<p>'Ah you like that?' Welfin asked - beginning to stroke his member. It filled him with such a rush of energy to see his doppleganger following suit, suspiciously.</p>
<p>'Yeah, you suspicious bitch' Welfin howled at his subconsious twin, who yelled the same, only suspiciously.</p>
<p>With his eyes locked on the oh so suspicious double Welfin knew felt the pleasure radiate through him. </p>
<p>This is what he had been sniffing for the whole time. </p>
<p>Welfin was spent. The emmisions of the last hour lay moist and stodgey upon the floor. His phalac self-tango had finally danced itself out.</p>
<p>"Well, me, I guess you're not so bad after all" he shouted to himself, as he clumsily clapped a paw on his own back.</p>
<p>He staired into the mirror before him, with nothing but his own terrible eyes staring back, sullen, bloodshot, desperate and empty.</p>
<p>He knew on some level that this was madness, he was no one but himself, his solitude was absolute. He had been locked underneath the palace for years, knowing full well that there was no world left for him to return to up there.</p>
<p>But still he dared himself to blink, to break the kafabe, and admit to himself the true depth of his lonelines.</p>
<p>He wouldn't let the coniving bastard in the mirror win.</p>

<p>"I know you still miss him..." Ging said, solemnly. </p>
<p>Beans looked up, not bothering to reply. They both knew who he was talking about. His lover, Netero. The man who he had been with for the last fifty years. The first man who had ever treated him not as a secretary, but as a friend - an equal, and then eventually, a lover.</p>
<p>"Look, I'm not good at this kind of mushy shit," Ging scratched his head, looking away, embarrassed, "but if you ever need to talk... or..."</p>
<p>"I don't need to talk!" Beans said in a voice so loud, that he surprised even himself. The weeks of grief pouring out in one furious outburst. "I need him here! Smiling at me, laughing with me, touching me..."</p>
<p>"Touching you?" Ging scratched his chin contemplatively. </p>
<p>"Yes touching me!" Beans said. There had been a time when the relationship between a geriatric kung-fu master and a sentient jelly-baby had been frowned upon. Those rights had been hard fought for and won at a great cost to the Hunter association, and he refused to be ashamed. To deny the physical, carnal aspect of his and Netero's relationship would be an insult to his memory. Equivalent to sacrilege. </p>
<p>"Calm down...calm down...," Said Ging in a tone, that distinctly did not make Beans want to calm down. He waned to hit him. Nonetheless Ging persisted, "if it's touching you need, I can help with that. I'm not good at this talking stuff anyway."</p>
<p>"What?" Asked Beans, genuinely, caught off guard.</p>
<p>Beans sighed and turned around, bent over, and flipped up the tails on his fancy little jacket. Ging was a pig, but at least Beans wasn't going to have to suffer from the old chairman's "Buhavada 69th Hand Technique"</p>
<p>"That's better, nothing like a big of soft beans ass after a hard day's hunting." Ging hummed to himself and he began the perfunctury work of releaving himself into the diminutive abomination against god.</p>
<p>Beans allowed his thoughts to wonder as the rhythmic slapping continued. His accrued holiday days were about to expire, where should he spend them? An island getaway perhaps? Or maybe a city break.</p>
<p>Ging started fishhooking him, pulling his head back and forcing him to lock eyes with the tousel hatted man.</p>
<p>There was no love in those eyes, only the drive to hunt for sweeter and sweeter ass.</p>
<p>Beans looked down, apple flavoured jelly bean cock pulling slowly from Ging's mouth, a train of arrogant-hunter spit linking his member and Gings arrogant whore mouth. </p>
<p>The triple star hunter, who had spent so much time being so mean to Beans, was now at his mercy bound and tied to within an inch of his life being mercilessly pounded by the now Nen-enlarged Beans. </p>
<p>He watched his refreshing, apple sours flavoured cum, drip from Ging's shite-dad lips and once again beheld those eyes. Finally understanding their place in all things. </p>
<p>Ging had signed himself away to learn Netero's secret, he had allowed his liberty to be stripped from him to find out the truth. </p>
<p>Beans and his 'Apple Flavoured Power Top' Hatsu was secretly the most pwowerful hunter to have ever lived, and now Ging his smart ass, son leaving mouth was his. Forever.</p>

<p>"Did you write that last one about me?" Chrollo Lucifer sat at the bar slowly stirring his G&T. He'd sat there unmoving and, seemingly, unmoved while Oscar had bared his soul on stage.</p>
<p>"I did, yeah" Oscar wanted to cry, to scream, to throw Chrollo's drink off the bar and flee from the lights and sound and feeling. But those soft dark eyes stripped everything away, and left him with nothing but honesty.</p>
<p>"It was good, I could tell that it hurt to play."</p>
<p>Oscar wasn't going to be drawn back in again, into the spider's web. Leaving had nearly been the death of him the first time, and he didn't have the strength to repeat past mistakes.</p>
<p>"Hey Oscar, we're all leaving to do ket with these cool belgian dames we've met" shouted an unwelcome Tim, the band's basist, wandering into the conversation and momentarily drawing the venom from Oscar's slowly re-opening wound.</p>
<p>Chrollo smiled after Tim as he moseyed away, before turning once again to Oscar.</p>
<p>"I've missed you," he said, soft voice somehow carrying over the din of the next band that had started playing "Everything I wrote down in my book doesn't come close to describing the whole of you."</p>
<p>Oscar felt his face burn red and Chrollo smirked. It wasn't wolfish though, it was, like everything he did, controlled, purposeful. </p>
<p>"You don't miss me?" Chrollo asked, extending his long pale fingers to touch Oscar's chin, lifting his jaw up so there eyes met. </p>
<p>"I've - I've moved on from that! From you!" Oscar said, trying to force conviction into his voice, but unable to turn his head away. "I've met someone else, they, they -"</p>
<p>"I'm sure they're simply wonderful." Chrollo smiled, and Oscar knew he was saying it to be cruel, although his voice belied no indication of that intent. </p>
<p>"They are!" Oscar argued, trying to sound defiant. </p>
<p>Chrollo just laughed indulgently, as if Oscar was a favoured nephew or a misbehaving child. Oscar didn't know he managed to do it. Chrollo had the brown  that by any objective measure should be described as 'doe-eyes' but instead of being warm and inviting, they were hard. Predatory.</p>
<p>Slowly, letting Oscar watch his every move, daring him to stop, Chrollo leaned in, until his lips were merely millimeters away from Oscar's ear. </p>
<p>Oscar tried not to shudder as he felt the whisper of warm breath caress his lobe, and his brain was unbiddenly filled with images of silken blindfolds, tight bindings, sweat, pleasure and pain. Ownership.</p>
<p>He was powerless to resist, as Chrollo pushed deeper into him. He felt himself cascade through OCEANS of pleasure.</p>
<p>The marks left by Chrolo's irresistable KISS WITH TEETH, still on his cherub-like chin, he felt himself be pulled further under. </p>
<p>he could see himself in the STRAIGHT LIGHT reflecting from Chrolo's eyes. he could see himself being subjugated. Pushed ONto THE ROPES again by a force of sexual majesty he could not fully comprehend. The long coat sweeping around his feet, all Oscar wanted was to belong to him. To feel safe, to feel protected, to feel used. </p>
<p>He wanted Chrolo to own him utterly. </p>

<p>"And just what would you do to get your clans eyes back?" Chrollo asked, his voice calm, dis-interested even, despite the bound chain-user, who lay naked at his feet.</p>
<p>Kurapika just spat in return. He knew he was already dead, he wasn't going to degrade himself further by answering any of Chrollo's asinine questions.</p>
<p>Chollo simply rolled his eyes at the gesture, before crouching on the floor, so he was now  level with the chain-user, and able to look directly into his piercing scarlet eyes. The gaze he gave was penetrating, and Kurapika, despite having his clothes stripped from him upon being captured, only now felt  truly naked, exposed.</p>
<p>"I suppose I could take your eyes too, add them to the collection," Chrollo mused, taking a fistful of blonde-hair, when Kurapika tried to drop his gaze, forcing them to retain eye contact. "But... I don't see the purpose of putting an item valued for it's beauty in a glass jar, when it is already being contained in a far prettier vessel." </p>
<p>For just a moment Kurapika felt his defiance slip, and his body stiffen. His once livid rage, was now accompanied by a violent jolt in his stomach. He had been prepared to die if he was caught, prepared for it from the moment he set out on his mission. But to be caught and to live...</p>
<p>"Now the question is," Chrollo continued thoughtfully, "Is whether to keep you alive. I do like the idea of having my own little doll -" </p>
<p>Kurapika shuddered at the insinuation. Of the man he hated above all others, keeping his dead body as an amusement.</p>
<p>"But on the other hand," Chrollo considered, "if you're dead, I won't get to see all of the other pretty faces you make. So yes," He said, his previously blank face breaking out into a smile, "I'll have you as my little doll. My little living doll."</p>
<p>Kurapika tensed, the chains Chrollo had stolen from him now binding him, helpless. </p>
<p>He watched out as Chrollo pulled his immaculate goth penish from his assless leather chaps. Kurapika had never noticed they where assless before, but now it just seemed so obvious. </p>
<p>As Chrollo walked tantalisingly around him, teasing him with the inevitable, Kurapika felt he hatred well up within him. </p>
<p>'Yes. Good.' Chrollo said, devoid of any emotion 'the hatred will only make this better.'</p>
<p>Kurapika suddenly felt what he had dreaded, </p>
<p>Despite all his hatred, Kurapika felt another chain begin snaking it's way around his supple body and felt the sexual excitement arise within him. </p>
<p>'The final chain, Sixth Penis-Finger: Aphrodisiac Chain',</p>
<p>The scarlet hatred coursing through Kurapika began to change and morph as his secret chain - stolen by an immaculate goth, turned his hatred to raw, animal, sexual desire.</p>
<p>His resistance disolved into nothingness, the fury and hatered and rage draining out of him and leaving him weak and pliant.</p>
<p>Chrollo jerked him down and to his knees by the chain, slipping a slender but powerful hand beneath Kurapika's well cut chinos.</p>
<p>This was the end, this was the resolution and absolution that Kirapika had searched for all these years. Not his hands soaked in their blood, but his thighs soaked in his own cum.</p>
<p>Chrollo cruely teased him into the night and through till morning, exacting with pleasure the same punishment that Kurapika had dealth Uvigon in pain."Look, just bend over."</p>
<p>"Sounds good man, I'll be out in 5"</p>
